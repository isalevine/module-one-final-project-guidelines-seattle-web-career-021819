# Show Randomizer

The Show Randomizer is a Ruby-based CLI program that helps users browse a database of tv shows, keep track of their favorite ones, and generate a random list of 10 episodes from their favorite shows. Stop wasting time trying to decide what show or episode to watch and let the Show Randomizer decide for you!
