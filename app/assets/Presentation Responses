Presentation (3 min max)
-Your Presentation Should:
  -Describe something you struggled to build, and show us how you ultimately implemented it in your code.
    -Option 1?
      We struggled to strip html tags from the show descriptions - using correct syntax for special characters is tricky!
      (~Line 220 from the CLI.rb file - see HORRIBLE chain of .gsub functions)
    -Option 2?
      Organized CLI/helper/run files - wasn't sure how to break up 300+ lines of code initially written,
      and debugging has involved a lot of searching through long files of 'def method' code, which are
      only loosely organized
    -Option 3?
      Making flexible and intuitive menus - we ended up making more menus than anticipated, and coding them to
      behave as expected for EVERY choice (and have flexibility in user input via a "thesaurus" helper method)
      required a lot of coding/refactoring/debugging, all of which grew exponentially with new menus.

  -Discuss 3 things you learned in the process of working on this project.
    -How to use github collaboratively! - specifically, using branches and resolving merge conflicts.
    -How to divide and conquer, (assign tasks for features and pair programming for backbone of program) - specifically,
      starting the project by pair programming all initial code so we both understood the structure inside and out,
      which allowed us to work independently work on individual features later in the week.
    -How to keep goals in sight (not getting carried away with features before getting core code done)

  -Address, if anything, what you would change or add to what you have today?
    -Additional features we'd like to add are listed on our README and listed as UNDER CONSTRUCTION in our program
    -More refactoring? Some methods are huge! And simply navigating the CLI & api-helper-method files is very hard.
    -Possible to export episode playlists to another program for expanded functionality?
      (i.e. specify a local directory, and use exported playlist to scan and search for/load video files by their titles?)

  -Present any code you would like to highlight.
    -USER_INPUT_THESAURUS.RB!!!!!!
    -our insane 100-line method (print_list_of_favorites)
      NO
    -[CLI.rb Line 147] get_array_of_tv_shows method
      figured out how to iterate through each page of results
    -api-helper-methods.rb - see tidy/straightforward methods at top, which
      get more complicated and convoluted as you go down the list...
      (see the progression of us building functionality, and getting more elaborate but dense and jumbled)
