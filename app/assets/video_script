  Welcome to the Show Randomizer!
  This is a ruby-based command line interface program
  that uses the EpisoDate API to query a database
  of tv shows. It'll let you favorite tv shows and generate
  a playlist of random episodes so you'll never have to
  worry about what to watch again!


        * The main functionality is to 
        find TV shows by title,
        add them to your list of favorites,
        and create playlists of randomly-selected episodes.

        * Additionally, users who want to keep their list of favorites
        can reload and customize their User Profile, check out their
        viewing statistics, and enable/disable certain shows from
        being added to playlists.

        * This video, we'll demonstrate the search and playlist generator,
        and give a quick overview of what users can do in their User Profile.


        *[Welcome Page]
        ---------------
        * On the welcome page, enter your user name.
        Or press enter to see a list of all users in the system.
        We'll use my username for this demo.

        ...

        * Here's the main menu.
        The program's main functionality is listed
        at the top of the menu options.
        We'll start by searching for two shows,
        adding them to our Favorites list,
        and creating a playlist from them.

        ...

        * Let's search for King of the Hill by entering 'king of'.
        Individual shows are selected by their unique ID number.
        Once the show's information loads, you can add to favorites,
        or search for another show.

        * Let's search for The Simpsons. Since there is only one result,
        the show information automatically loads.
        We'll add it to our Favorites.

        * One more--Futurama.

        * Press enter to go back to the main menu.

        ...

        * Let's see our list of Favorites. Here, you can remove a show
        by entering its ID number. Let's remove The Simpsons.

        * Press enter to go back to the main menu.

        ...

        * Now let's create a playlist! Enter the number of episodes
        you want on the playlist.
        The program will randomly select episodes from all the shows
        on your Favorites list!

        * Enjoy watching!

Welcome to the Show Randomizer!
This is a ruby-based command line interface program
that uses the EpisoDate API to query a database
of tv shows. It'll let you favorite tv shows and generate
a playlist of random episodes so you'll never have to
worry about what to watch again!


[Welcome Page]
--------------
You can see here on the welcome page that we have the option
to enter a username, or to see a list of all users.
We'll take a list of all current users first by hitting enter.
(PRESS ENTER)
As you can see, we already have a few users in our system.
We'll hit enter again to get back to the previous page...
(PRESS ENTER)
...and we'll use my username for this demo.
(TYPE 'yutaro', HIT ENTER)
[USER PAGE]
-----------
Here we have quite a few options to pick from, so we'll start
with option 1 and search for a show
(TYPE '1' AND PAUSE)
Take note that we can enter either the number for the option
or the word associated with that option. In this case, we can
use 'search', 'show', even 's', 'se', 'find', 'title',
They'll all work.
(HIT ENTER)
Now we can search for a tv show by its title and I like Brooklyn
Nine-Nine, so I'm going to look for brooklyn.
(TYPE 'brooklyn' AND HIT ENTER)
You'll see we get a total of 14 search results in alphabetical order
Now the one I'm looking for is going to be id - 34496, so I'll enter
that and hit enter
(TYPE '34496' AND HIT ENTER)
Just a note, if there were only 1 result from the search, it'll
jump directly to the show detail screen like the one shown here.
Here you can see all the details for the tv show such as the title,
genre, air date, network, number of season, and description.
From here, we have the option to 'Add to Favorites', 'View list of seasons/episodes', 'search for another title', 'go back to the main menu', or quit the program. I'm going to add this show to my favorites and this time I'll use 'fave'...
(TYPE 'fave' AND HIT ENTER)
We see we get confirmation at the top that the show was added.
We can try adding it again and it'll let us know that it's
already in our favorites.
(TYPE 1 AND HIT ENTER)
We'll go back to the main menu and see what our current list of
favorites looks like.
You can see Brooklyn Nine-Nine is included along with a few other
shows that I had already favorited. From here, I can also delete
shows from my favorites by entering their show ID.
Let's say I don't want Bob's Burgers from my favorites anymore,
so I'll type in '23568', hit enter, and you can see it's removed
with a notification at the top confirming that it was removed.
You'll notice, there are 'Add to playlist' indications to the right
of each show, and this is to specify whether or not you want to
include the show when generating the list of random episodes.
Newly added tv shows will be set to ON by default and these can be
toggled on and off from the user profile.
We'll take a look at that now, so we'll go back to the main menu,
and jump into the user profile.
[USER PROFILE]
Here you'll see some stats on the user such as the username, real name, profile created and updated dates as well as some interesting
ones, like number of favorite shows, total episodes, total runtime, and average episodes per show. There are additional ones listed as
'UNDER CONSTRUCTION' that will be for future iterations of this project
You can see we have the option to remove shows from the favorites
list as demonstrated previously, as well as changing the username,
or the real name.
We'll go into the first option to toggle the playlist option on and off
(GO INTO OPTION 1)
So let's say I want to keep The League in my favorites list, but
don't want it included in my generated playlist. I can enter '23136' and it'll show that 'add to playlists' is now OFF.
Now we'll go back to the profile menu and back out to the main menu
Now we can generate a playlist so we don't have to waste time
trying to decide what show or what episode to watch!
We'll go into option 3 and it'll prompt us how many episodes
we'd like in the playlist. Let's say we want 15 episodes..
(ENTER 15)
You can see we get a list of episodes with the show name, season number, episode number and episode title, AS WELL AS an estimated
runtime as the bottom
Also note that the playlist doesn't include any episodes from
The League since we toggled that option OFF.
NOW we'll go back to the main menu and take a look at some of
the program stats. Here we have general stats such as the number
of users and playlists, average number of playlists, average number
of episodes per playlist, total number of favorites by all users,
and the total number of unique shows favorited by all users.
(HIT ENTER)
AND that's it! Hope you all find this tool useful in finding your
next tv show.
(HIT 0 AND ENTER)
Thank you!

    -How to use github collaboratively!
    -How to divide and conquer, (assign tasks for features and pair programming for backbone of program)
    -How to keep goals in sight (not getting carried away with features before getting core code done)
  -Address, if anything, what you would change or add to what you have today?
    -Additional features we'd like to add are listed on our README and listed as UNDER CONSTRUCTION in our program
